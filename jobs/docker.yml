# This is an opinionated (read, very likely just wrong :) ) job to build and publish a docker container, with $version
# supplied by the extending pipeline, and one additional tag, likely latest.  It's intended to be at least a little reusable
# but you should make sure it fits your need before using. see gitlab-library issue 11 for work to future proof this code.
